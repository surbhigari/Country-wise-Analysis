# Project Repository

1. To run the codes, you can simply set the working directory as the folder that you are in.
We've arranged the files in such a manner that there won't be any need to cross access between folders.
For example, if you want to run the shiny app, set the shiny app folder as the working directory.
If you want to run the data extraction code, set the data extraction sub-folder within the FinalData folder as the working directory.

2. Following are the packages that we've used for project report. Before running the project report code, kindly ensure that these are installed.
heatmaply,
ggplot2,
viridis,
reshape2,
dplyr,
plotly

3. There is a folder called project files in report folder, which was automatically created while rendering the qmd file. So, we've included it as the file can't run without it. Also we've made the report in a html format due to alignment issues in the graph in a normal pdf format.
